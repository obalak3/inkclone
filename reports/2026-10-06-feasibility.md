# Feasibility check on `Multivariable Calculus.pdf` (GoodNotes export, 24 pages)

- Ink is vector: page 2 has 0 images, 731 filled paths, ~86k bezier segments. 22 of 24 pages are handwritten.
- Paths are filled outlines (pressure pen), ribbons ~0.5pt wide (p10 0.27, p90 0.74). Width = pressure proxy.
- One PDF path = one pen stroke, but split into 3-10 closed sub-loops. Stroke order is preserved by draw order.
- GoodNotes embeds an invisible OCR text layer (render mode 3) with word boxes. Prose is mostly right, equations are garbage.
- Centerline recovery test on "Distance" (rasterize 600dpi + skeletonize): clean, 7 components for 8 letters, matches the real joins ("ance" is one stroke).

Open question: target documents are math or prose? Math needs its own layout + symbol work.
